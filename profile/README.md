## Our team

The entire group was part of the project, and we all contributed  jointly to its development. We had 2 main project leadership teams:

1. PM (Project Manager)
2. LA (Lead Architect)

Whose members were mostly absorbed into the following 4 development teams due to the intense requirements of the project development.

1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. DataBase
4. Security

Each team was in charge of a different part of the project and each had their own internal hierarchies for management and for leadership.
