Dittravel's logo represents a clear connection to Ditta Consulting, our formative partner, while incorporating elements that symbolize the main focus of the project, a travel management software. The design features an airplane icon, formed by a stylized "D" and "T", which are the initials of Dittravel, mantaining a strong visual link to Ditta Consulting's branding throught the use of the blue color palette. The logo's design reflects the company's commitment to innovation by keeping a unique perspective over rudimentary elements like letters.

## Language and Documentation

- **GitHub in English:** All repository content, including issues, pull requests, commit messages, and branch names, must be in English to maintain consistency and accessibility for international contributors.
- **Documentation in Spanish:** Project documentation, such as test plans, design documnents, etc.

### Code Style
- **Variable Naming:** Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., `userName`, `isActive`). This applies to both JavaScript/TypeScript and any other languages used in the project.
- **Indentation:** Respect consistent indentation. Use 2 spaces for indentation in all code files to ensure readability and uniformity across the codebase.
- **Comments:** Place descriptive comments above each function explaining what it does. Add inline comments within functions only for complex logic that requires additional clarification.

### Technology Stack
- **Languages:** The project uses a mix of TypeScript and JavaScript within the Astro framework. Prefer TypeScript for new components and utilities to leverage type safety, falling back to JavaScript only when necessary.

### Version Control
- **Branch Naming:** Each branch name must include the owner's name and the relevant area (e.g., `diego-frontend-auth`, `isabela-backend-api`). This helps in tracking contributions and organizing work.
- **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise commit messages in English, starting with a verb (e.g., "Add user authentication", "Fix login bug"). Reference issue numbers when applicable.

### Project Structure
- **File Organization:** Maintain a clean folder structure. Group related files in appropriate directories (e.g., components in `src/components/`, utilities in `src/utils/`).
- **Imports:** Use relative imports for files within the same module and absolute imports for shared utilities to keep dependencies clear.

### Best Practices
- **Code Reviews:** All pull requests require review from at least one team member before merging to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Testing:** Write tests for new features and bug fixes. Aim for good test coverage, especially for critical functionality.
- **Main Pull Request:** Only Diego Córdova Rodríguez (A01781166) is authorized to create pull requests to the main branch, ensuring a controlled and consistent integration process.
