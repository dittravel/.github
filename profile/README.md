# Dittravel

Dittravel is a ficticious software consulting firm created for the purposes of the project made by students of group 102 (later 501) of the courses TC3004B and TC3005B of Tec de Monterrey Campus Santa Fe for Ditta Consulting, our formative partners. The project was carried out during the February-June 2025 semester, and resulted in the creation of the project repository [TC3005B.501](https://github.com/dittravel/TC3005B.501).

## Our team

The entire group was part of the project, and we all contributed  jointly to its development. We had 2 main project leadership teams:

1. PM (Project Manager)
2. LA (Lead Architect)

Whose members were mostly absorbed into the following 4 development teams due to the intense requirements of the project development.

1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. DataBase
4. Security

Each team was in charge of a different part of the project and each had their own internal hierarchies for management and for leadership.
