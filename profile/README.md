# Dittravel

Dittravel is a ficticious software consulting firm created for the purposes of the project made by students of group 102 (later 501) of the courses TC3004B and TC3005B of Tec de Monterrey, Santa Fe Campus for Ditta Consulting, our formative partners. The project was carried out during the February-June 2025 semester, and resulted in the creation of the project repository [TC3005B.501](https://github.com/dittravel/TC3005B.501).

Dittravel's logo represents a clear connection to Ditta Consulting, our formative partner, while incorporating elements that symbolize the main focus of the project, a travel management software. The design features an airplane icon, formed by a stylized "D" and "T", which are the initials of Dittravel, mantaining a strong visual link to Ditta Consulting's branding throught the use of the blue color palette. The logo's design reflects the company's commitment to innovation by keeping a unique perspective over rudimentary elements like letters.

## Our team

The entire group was part of the project, and we all contributed  jointly to its development. We had 2 main project leadership teams:

1. PM (Project Manager)
2. LA (Lead Architect)

Whose members were mostly absorbed into the following 4 development teams due to the intense requirements of the project development.

1. Frontend
2. Backend
3. DataBase
4. Security

Each team was in charge of a different part of the project and each had their own internal hierarchies for management and for leadership.
